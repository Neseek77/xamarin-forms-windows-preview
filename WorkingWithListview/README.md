These samples relate to the [Working with ListView in Xamarin.Forms](http://developer.xamarin.com/guides/cross-platform/xamarin-forms/working-with/listview) doc.

Many people have questions about specific `ListView` features, this sample attempts to cover some of them:

* De-selecting the row after tapping
* Uneven row heights
* Adding clickable buttons to cells that work on Android

See the [working with ListView "native layouts"](https://github.com/xamarin/xamarin-forms-samples/tree/master/WorkingWithListviewNative) for tips on using custom renderers for cells or the entire `ListView`.

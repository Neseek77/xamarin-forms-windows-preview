This sample is an updated version of [Roget1911](https://github.com/conceptdev/Roget1911/) from 2009! This version uses [Xamarin.Forms](http://xamarin.com/forms) to provide cross-platform shared user interface code.

The list screen is a native UITableView/Android ListView and the detail view uses the platform's native web view to display a Razor-generated Html.
